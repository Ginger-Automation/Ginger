# Why we created Ginger? Is it just another Automation tool/framework? Why is it different?
Same like many testing organizations we used a commercial tool for our testing, and added on top of it a framework to with our libraries and needs, it worked great for many years but had several limitations: like machine is locked for testing, one test at a time, slow execution, required VBScript knowledge.    During the evolution of digital and more free open source automation libraries, we wanted something smarter, easier to use and maintain, and yes we wanted it to be free too, in 2014 we looked at several open source libraries like Selenium, Appium and since we also needed to automate Windows Apps, PowerBuilder, MF and Linux we decided to create a wrapper with nice UI on top of all these free libraries, and that's where it all started.
We wanted one IDE for all platforms. Making it easy for a tester to create scripts while focusing on WHAT to test and not HOW to test.
we have created a unified framework, with amazing UI to make it cool and fun to work with. Of course, developers can utilize it as well to quickly test their application.
Ginger is a full Automation IDE, not an automation library for specific platform, we have a lot of great ideas for our roadmap which is going to make Ginger even greater, we have more than 1,000 Unique users per month running Ginger, and millions of executions, with all the great feedback we got so far and many requests to make it open source we have decided to contribute it to the community for everyone to enjoy.
